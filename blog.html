        		<h1>Golang Introduction - Day 1  </h1>
			<p>Earlier days , we had single core and thus the programming was done keeping in mind with single core.<br />
Nowadays things have changed . we have multi cores and lots of servers have two digits cores in them.
<pre>
Even the style or the way we used to code has changed. My friend can sit in Kolkata and me in Chennai and still can deliver our work and make progress.

Projects are broken down into modules and are assigned to each of the team members in different locations .

Libraries / Packages comes to the rescue . 
As they say <quote>"Don't reinvent the wheel"</quote> . 
what I am talking about here is <b>code reuse</b> . 
I can use the libraries created by any other developer in my module and use its feature.

So let's try to see what's go is all about.

Go is a programming language created by Rob Pike , Robert Griesemer , Ken Thomson at Google . - wikipedia for more info or more better - 
<a href=http://golang.org > golang</a> 

What I have seen in my few months about Golang is that it gives the developer both the performance and to develop rapidly. 

So its Rapid Development AND Performance rather than Rapid Development OR Performance.

English Language has 26 letters and Golang have 25 keywords . Yes , that's all one has to know .
Take the world and paint it with Golang in your own way.
</pre>

Will see more about golang in upcoming blogs. 

Thanks and Happy Coding
